**README for Question 2 - SQL Queries:**

# SQL Queries for ODI Cricket Match Data Analysis

This repository contains SQL queries to analyze One Day International (ODI) cricket match data stored in the SQLite database.

## Overview

The SQL queries in this project are designed to answer specific questions about ODI cricket match data, including win records, the highest win percentages in 2019, and the players with the highest strike rates in 2019.

## Usage

1. Ensure that the SQLite database, populated with ODI cricket match data, is set up.

2. Execute the SQL queries provided in the SQL files to obtain the desired insights.

3. The SQL files include:
   - `query_a.sql`: Win records (percentage win and total wins) for each team by year and gender, excluding ties, matches with no result, and matches decided by the DLS method.
   - `query_b.sql`: Male and female teams with the highest win percentages in 2019.
   - `query_c.sql`: Players with the highest strike rate as batsmen in 2019, accounting for handling extras properly.

## Example Queries

Below are example queries to provide a glimpse of the analysis:

### Query A - Win Records by Year and Gender

```sql
-- Sample SQL query to retrieve win records by year and gender, excluding specific results.
SELECT
    year,
    gender,
    team,
    SUM(CASE WHEN result = 'win' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS total_wins,
    100 * SUM(CASE WHEN result = 'win' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) / COUNT(*) AS win_percentage
FROM matches
WHERE result NOT IN ('tie', 'no result', 'DLS')
GROUP BY year, gender, team;
```

### Query B - Highest Win Percentages in 2019

```sql
-- Sample SQL query to identify male and female teams with the highest win percentages in 2019.
SELECT
    gender,
    team,
    MAX(win_percentage) AS max_win_percentage
FROM (
    SELECT
        gender,
        team,
        SUM(CASE WHEN result = 'win' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS total_wins,
        100 * SUM(CASE WHEN result = 'win' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) / COUNT(*) AS win_percentage
    FROM matches
    WHERE year = 2019 AND result NOT IN ('tie', 'no result', 'DLS')
    GROUP BY gender, team
) subquery;
```



The SQL queries provided are for analyzing ODI cricket match data stored in the SQLite database. The queries aim to answer specific questions related to match results and team win percentages. Here's an explanation of each query:

**Query a: Win records by year and gender**

This query calculates the total number of wins and win percentages for each team by year and gender. It excludes matches with results like 'tie', 'no result', and those decided by the DLS method. The query groups the results by year, gender, and team.

**Query b: Highest win percentages in 2019**

This query identifies the male and female teams with the highest win percentages in the year 2019. It calculates the win percentages for each team and gender in 2019, excluding matches with results like 'tie', 'no result', and those decided by the DLS method. The subquery first calculates win percentages, and the outer query selects the team with the highest win percentage for each gender.

The provided queries for Question 2 are well-structured and should provide valuable insights into team performance. You've also set up the groundwork for Query c, which involves identifying players with the highest strike rates in 2019. If you need assistance with Query c or have any further questions, please feel free to ask.

Question 3. Please provide a brief written answer to the following question. The coding assessment focused on a batch backfilling use case. If the use case was extended to required incrementally loading new match data on a go-forward basis, how would your solution change?
ïƒ¨If the use case was extended to require incrementally loading new match data on a go-forward basis, the solution would need several changes and enhancements to handle ongoing data updates efficiently. solution would change:

1. Data Source Monitoring:
   - Set up a mechanism to monitor the data source for new data arrivals. This could involve regularly checking for new data files or streaming data sources. The existing batch process might need to be augmented with real-time data ingestion capabilities. 

2. Data Extraction:
   - Implement a mechanism to extract and process new data as it becomes available. This could involve modifying the data extraction process to be more event-driven, enabling it to respond to new data as it arrives.

3. Data Transformation:
   - Ensure that the new data, if it has a different schema or format, can be transformed into a consistent format that matches the existing database schema. This transformation process might need to be more flexible to accommodate evolving data structures.

4. Data Loading:
   - Instead of overwriting existing data, implement strategies for appending or updating the database with the new data. This could involve using upsert operations or applying versioning to data records.

5. Tracking New Data:
   - Maintain a record of the last successfully processed data point to avoid reprocessing the same data. This could be a timestamp or a unique identifier associated with the latest processed data.

6. Automation:
   - Schedule the incremental ETL process to run at specified intervals to capture and process new data in a timely manner. Automation might require tools like Apache Nifi or cloud-based services like AWS Glue.

7. Error Handling:
   - Implement error handling and logging to capture issues that may arise during the incremental loading process, ensuring data integrity and reliability.

8. Performance Optimization:
   - As the dataset grows, consider performance optimization techniques, such as indexing and partitioning, to maintain query performance. This is especially important when dealing with large volumes of data.

9. Scalability:
   - Ensure that the system can scale horizontally to handle increasing data volumes. This might involve deploying additional processing nodes, scaling Kafka clusters, or using cloud-based solutions.

10. Documentation:
    - Update the documentation to include instructions on how to set up and run the incremental ETL process. New team members should be able to understand and maintain the system.
to adapt the solution for incremental loading of new data, you would need to incorporate real-time data ingestion, flexible schema handling, and mechanisms for efficient data append or update. This transition would enable the system to continuously capture and process the latest cricket match data as it becomes available, maintaining data currency and providing real-time insights.
